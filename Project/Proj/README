The code is run by executing the command:

mpirun -np p mc N output_file

where p is the number of processes to run the program, N = n*p is the 
total amount of Monte Carlo experiments to conduct and output_file is the 
file to write the output to. 

The output consists of a table of the timings for the sub intervals followed
by the ranges of the histogram as well as the ranges for all of the bins. 
Lastly, the counts of each bin is presented as a vector. 

After the output file is produced, the largest execution time is written to the terminal
